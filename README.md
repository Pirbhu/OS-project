# Parallel Processing of Algorithms

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Operating Systems course** to analyze and compare the performance of **sequential and parallel programming techniques**.

The project evaluates three programming approaches:
- **Serial (Sequential Execution)**
- **Multi-threading using Pthreads**
- **Parallel Programming using OpenMP**

These techniques are tested on different **sorting algorithms** to determine which approach performs best under varying data sizes.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To compare **Serial, Pthreads, and OpenMP** programming techniques  
- To analyze execution time and CPU burst time  
- To understand the impact of **parallelism on performance**  
- To observe how data size affects efficiency
